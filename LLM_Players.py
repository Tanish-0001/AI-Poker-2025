                structured as follows.
                [hole card 1, hole card 2, community card 1, community card 2, community card 3, community card 4, community card 5,

                game number]\n
                The cards will be given as a string of two characters, with the rank followed by the suit. The string "XX" indicates that the card has not been revealed yet. The current raise amount includes the big blind.\n
                Given the game state, you have to make a move in the game. You have to decide the action and the amount you will put in the pot. You will either call, raise or fold. Consider check as call with amount 0. The amount will be 0 should you choose to fold.
                \nHere is the action history of the current game:
                {action_history}
                \n\nHere is the game state, as a list of numbers:
                {game_state}
                \nYou are {name} and you currently have {stack} dollars.
                \nYou must provide only the action and the amount, and nothing else. Saying anything else will disqualify you and forcefully fold your hand.
                \n\nYour output must be in the format:\nACTION, AMOUNT
